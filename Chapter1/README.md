### Why Command Line?

Linux command line interface is very powerful. It seems complicated, but once you get used to it, it can open a world of possibilities that normally would take much longer to complete. Additionally, the command line is the easiest way to interract with a Linux system when it comes to software development.

To open a terminal, the program we use to interact with the command line, we click the dots at the bottom of the screen, and type "terminal".

### Command Resources

There are many terminal commands, and each command has its own subset of special use cases. How can we possibly know all of the special commands to use? This is where man pages come in. Man pages are the manual on how to use a specific command. Additionally, some commands may have a "-h", or "--help" flag that helps us to figure out what kinds of input the command can handle.
