### Why Command Line?

Linux command line interface is very powerful. It seems complicated, but once you get used to it, it can open a world of possibilities that normally would take much longer to complete. Additionally, the command line is the easiest way to interract with a Linux system when it comes to software development.

To open a terminal, the program we use to interact with the command line, we click the dots at the bottom of the screen, and type "terminal".

### Directories

In linux, much like Windows, directories are nested in a tree structure.

![Directories](images/directories.png)

All directories stem from the root directory, also known as "/". 
Every user on the system has a home directory in /home, also known as "~". 
Anytime you are using a terminal, the current directory you are in is aliased as ".",
and the parent directory (the directory directly above your current directory) is "..".

#### Directory Commands:
Below are some of the most common commands for working with directories.

* ls	- lists the contents of a directory
