### Libraries

One of the greatest things about Python is its extensive libraries. If you need to do something with Python, there is probably a library for it. I've found libraries for working with motor controllers, reading and writing to and from databases, working with excel spreadsheets, to even controlling drones! Many libraries come preinstalled with Python. To view a list of all of the modules installed on your computer, open the python interpreter and run the following command:

> help("modules")

One of my favorite libraries that we will be getting into shortly is the socket library. This library exposes the network interfaces of your machine to where we can talk to other computers.

To import a library in Python, at the top of the script just place an import ttatemtn like this:

> import moduleName

### Working with pip

Some libraries need to be installed, as they don't come prepackaged with Python. there are a few ways to do this but the simplest way is to use pip. To install pip, you run this command:

> sudo apt-get install python-pip

Now, you can typically install libraries like this:

> sudo pip install [library_name]

Some libraries don't install so cleanly, so you'll have to follow their installation instructions. If things get too messy, please feel free to reach out to me.
