Software Developer's guide for NASA RMC
=====

This guide is designed to help bridge the gap between academia and practical application of software development for aerospace and other engineers for robotics senior design projects. This is by no means a complete guide to your specific senior design project, nor is it likely to contain the most efficient or practical approaches. This is simply something we have taken the time to draft up based on experiences we have encountered. 

Each chapter is organized in a crawl, walk, run methodology to help the developer incrementally build their skills. To get the most out of each chapter, please complete the exercises at the end. Additionally, if you have any questions about the content of this guide, please email me at: jconnolly2016@my.fit.edu
